Who are you talking to Jack? YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!! Bingo! Are there any questions? What?  </s>  Then let's begin with the story itself. It's a story of the Grail myth...And although there are several variations, my favorite begins with the Fisher King as a young boy... who had to spend a night alone in the forest to prove his courage... and during that night, he is visited by a sacred vision. Out of the fire, appears the Holy Grail  God's highest symbol of divine grace. And a voice says to the boy, "You shall be the guardian of the Grail, that it may heal the hearts of men"...But the boy was overcome ...Innocent and foolish, he was blinded by greater visions  a life ahead filled with beauty and glory, hope and power...Tears filled his eyes as he sensed his own... invincibility. A boy's tears of naive wonder and inspiration. and in this state of...radical amazement...he felt for a brief moment, not like a boy, but like God... ...And so he reached into the fire to take the Grail. And the Grail vanished. And the boy hands were left caught in the flames...leaving him wounded and ashamed at what his recklessness had lost him. When he became King, he was determined to reclaim his destiny and find the Grail... But with each year that passed, with each campaign he fought, the Grail remained lost, and this wound he suffered in the fire grew worse... He became a bitter man. Life for him lost it's reason. With each disappointment, with each betrayal... with each loss ... this wound would grow... Soon the land began to spoil from neglect and his people starved...Until finally, the King lost all faith in God's existance and in man's value...He lost his ability to love or be loved And he was so sick with experience... that he started to die. As the years went on, his bravest knights would search for the Grail that would heal their King and make them the most respected and valued men in the land, but to no avail. Pretty soon, finding the Grail became a ruthless struggle between ambitious men vying for the King's power, which only confirmed the King's worst suspicions of man, causing his wound to grow. His only hope, he thought, was death. Then one day, a fool was brought in to the King to cheer him. He was a simpleminded man... not particularly skilled...or admired... He tells the King some jokes...sing him some songs, but the King feels even worse...Finally, the fool says, "What is it that hurts you so much? How can I help?"...And the King says, "I need a sip of water to cool my throat"...So, the fool takes a cup from the bedstand, fills it with water and hands it to the King...Suddenly, the King feels a lot better. And when he looks to his hands, he sees that it was the Holy Grail the fool handed him...an ordinary cup that had been beside his bed all along...And the King asks, "How can this be?...how could you find what all my knights and wisest men could not find"? And the fool answers, "I don't know. I only knew you were thirsty."... And for the first time since he was a boy, the King felt more than a man  not because he was touched by God's glory...but rather, by the compassion of a fool.  </s>

You gotta be awful careful who you hit up with, is what I always say, and you can't be too particular, neither. Once when I was comin' through North Carolina, I got to gabbin' with a goodlookin' mama. One of those young ones, you know, and plenty classy, too. Kinda struck my fancy. You know how it is. Well, sir, you could'a knocked me over with a Mack truck. I was just warming up when she's yanked offa the bus. Who do you think she was? Huh? Might as well give up. The girl bandit!

Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good? He thinks he looks young. What's this country coming to? Take it to the next level.

Imagine yourself one of his victims, realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking? My guess: he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae. Every cop has a story and every story has a girl. The girl in my story was fifteen yearsold. She wore a pink angora sweater  I can still see it  one day, she disappeared. I told the police she wouldn't run away, I told them who to look for, but I was just a kid. I sat in the police station crying and crying. My parents took me home. The girl was my cousin and the man who abducted her was a teacher I'd had. He kept her alive a week before he killed her. The police could have saved her. Every time I see a photo of a victim I see her. That's what I want to do. I want to save her. Me too. Make any headway with "Zorro"? None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online.

obviously we've got to work together on all are you listening to me on all the different parts of the body you want them all to come alive okay so this week as I say we're gonna concentrate on sound sound sound sound you've got to play on sound that is the painting I mean the the pictures do you alright that's fine at the same doesn't matter we've still got to work on different things yeah okay er m so as I say we're going to make a sound machine in different groups now to give you an example what I what you to do is be I'm going to give you a situation give choose a profession okay let's say we are in hospital now I want you each and everyone of you in this group think of the situation think of a sound that one might hear in a hospital everyone to themselves just think of a sound could be a patient screaming it could be a heart machine it could beer exactly could be that could be absolutely anything it could sirens it could be anything okay for everyone I want you to have the sound in your head okay everyone's got a sound in their head Yeah just an example now when I come round and tap you I want you to make your sound and will you keep on making that sound repeatedly until I clap like that and tell you to stop okay so if I tap you go on you make your sound and you carry on and on and on I'm gonna keep on taping different people's make their sound and then we're gonna see what it feels like you're in hospital okaynow it doesn't matter if somebody's got the same sound as somebody else it's no big deal alright because eventually they'll all blend into each other but as soon as I've tapped you make your sound alright patients come on where's the machines okay stop now when did it start becoming out of hand at one stage we didn't really know where we were to once once I say ten people okay and that was also due to the fact that we had perhaps too many er m patients moaning alright it was good in one respect because why it made obvious that we were in a a hospital well something like but er m when you're in smaller groups and you're making your sound machines obviously it's much easier to to control and to make the overall sound more realistic don't you think so mm what we're going to do is we're going to get into different groups into groups of four five no big deal you're welcome to only if you want to and you're going to each group is going to choose er a profession okay you can be brick layers you can be er musicians er you can be er gardener I mean absolutely you can be factory workers you can be absolutely anything and what you're going to do is you're going to choose each person will choose a sound which is represented of that particular person er profession okay and you'll going to make your sounds simultaneously so that as for the audience who are simply listening to you can just close our eyes cos we won't you won't be acting you'll be making these sounds and using we'll close our eyes and we'll know exactly where we are okay and then after that once we've done that just before you choose your profession to know what this is going to lead on to after that we're going to put movements to that profession so when if you were

So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing..... Yeah? ....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying.... You were talking about the promotion   the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79  that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes? Yeah. That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code  in other words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see? Yeah.  </s>  You see?  </s>
